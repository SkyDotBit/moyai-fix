## About
This Bunny plugin lets you play custom sounds when an emoji is sent (moyai is the default). Because it's a Bunny plugin, it will work with all Bunny forks like Revenge.
## Changes
- Custom emoji support (Does not support Nitro emojis/FreeNitro emojis)
- Custom sound support
- Ignore silent mode option
## Credit
- Cynosphere - Original developer

- Thank you, Nexpid, for the help and the deps.ts file!!
## Notes
- iOS does not support .ogg or .webm files.
- This has been developed with iOS in mind. If you use Android and encounter any issues, you can DM me (Sky.Bit) on Discord @sky.bit, and I will attempt to fix it.
